    "I think men mostly have to learn to be anarchists. Women don't have to learn.",
    "There was always a kind of psychological clear space around Mitis, like the lack of clouds around the peak of a mountain. The absence of all enhancements and enforcements of authority left the real thing plain. There are people of inherent authority; some emperors actually have clothes.",
    "To be whole is to be part; true voyage is return.",
    "Letters! Letters to propertarians, to subjects of governments founded on the inequity of power, to individuals who were inevitably exploited by and exploiters of others, because they had consented to be elements in the State-Machine. Did such people actually exchange ideas with free people in a nonaggressive, voluntary manner? Could they really admit equality and participate in intellectual solidarity, or were they merely trying to dominate, to assert their power, to possess?",
    "Surely freedom lay rather in openness than in secrecy, and freedom is always worth the risk.",
    "He tried to read an elementary economics text; it bored him past endurance, it was like listening to somebody interminably recounting a long and stupid dream. He could not force himself to understand how banks functioned and so forth, because all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary. In a human sacrifice to deity there might be at least a mistaken and terrible beauty; in the rites of the money-changers, where greed, laziness, and envy were assumed to move all men's acts, even the terrible became banal.",
    "'But what,' Oiie said abruptly, as if the question, long kept back, burst from him under pressure, 'what keeps people in order? Why don't they rob and murder each other?'\n'Nobody owns anything to rob. If you want things you take them from the depository. As for violence, well, I don't know, Oiie; would you murder me, ordinarily? And if you felt like it, would a law against it stop you? Coercion is the least efficient means of obtaining order.'",
    "...[his morality] was still fitted to a rigid mold, the simplistic Odonianism taught to children by mediocre adults, an internalized preaching.",
    "A child free from the guilt of ownership and the burden of economic competition will grow up with the will to do what needs doing and the capacity for joy in doing it. It is useless work that darkens the heart. The delight of the nursing mother, of the scholar, of the successful hunter, of the good cook, of the skillful maker, of anyone doing needed work and doing it wellâ€”this durable joy is perhaps the deepest source of human affection, and of sociality as a whole.",
    "It was easy to share when there was enough, even barely enough, to go round. But when there was not enough? Then force entered in; might making right; power, and its tool, violence, and its most devoted ally, the averted eye.",
    "Existence is its own justification, need is right.",
    "The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.",
    "He had been groping and grabbing after certainty, as if it were something he could possess. He had been demanding a security, a guarantee, which is not granted, and which, if granted, would become a prison.",
    "We make justice here, or nowhere.",
    "...he now understood why the army was organized as it was. It was indeed quite necessary. No rational form of organization would serve the purpose. He simply had not understood that the purpose was to enable men with machine guns to kill unarmed men and women easily and in great quantities when told to do so. Only he still could not see where courage, or manliness, or fitness entered in.",
    "It isn't changing around from place to place that keeps you lively. It's getting time on your side. Working with it, not against it.",
    "A scientist can pretend that his work isn't himself, it's merely the impersonal truth. An artist can't hide behind the truth. He can't hide anywhere.",
    "Those who build walls are their own prisoners",
    "A healthy society would let [everyone] exercise [their] optimum function freely",
    "'In the end, the truth usually insists upon serving only the common good,' Keng said.\n'In the end, yes, but I am not willing to wait for the end. I have one lifetime, and I will not spend it for greed and profiteering and lies. I will not serve _any_ master.'",
    "...there is nothing here but States and their weapons, the rich and their lies, and the poor and their misery. There is no way to act rightly, with a clear heart, on Urras. There is nothing you can do that profit does not enter into, and fear of loss, and the wish for power. You cannot say good morning without knowing which of you is 'superior' to the other, or trying to prove it. You cannot act like a brother to other people, you must manipulate them, or command them, or obey them, or trick them.",
    "Weigh it in the balance with the freedom of one single human spirit, and which will weigh heavier? Can you tell? I cannot.",
    "For we each of us deserve everything, every luxury that was ever piled in the tombs of the dead kings, and we each of us deserve nothing, not a mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not eaten while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving while others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward. Free your mind of the idea of _deserving_, the idea of _earning_, and you will begin to be able to think.",
    "Once you are there, once you walk through the wall with me, then as I see it you are one of us. We are responsible to you and you to us; you become an Anaresti, with the same options as all the others. But they are not safe options. Freedom is never very safe.",
    "They say there is nothing new under any sun. But if each life is not new, each single life, then why are we born?"
